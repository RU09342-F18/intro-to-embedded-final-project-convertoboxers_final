# Final Project: Smart Crowd Detection System
The final project is design to use an IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, MSP430F5529, and ESP8266 WiFi Module to 
detect the amount of people in an area when they trigger the sensors. The MSP430 transmits the data onto to the WiFi module 
and uses MQTT protocol to deliever the information onto a MQTT broker or cloud server. By establishng a connection through the 
MQTT broker, anyone will be able to subscribe to the topic and be able to see the real time data of the counter.
